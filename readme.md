# Color My World #

An application that allows users to navigate, browse, and save colors locally. This application was manily an experiment in using Backbone, Backbone-localstorage, and requirejs to develop an application framework. The results are pretty cool, if a little bit esoteric.

> Note: If you plan on running this locally, it needs to be run from a server so that the AJAX requests can be made.
